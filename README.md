# marienbad-ruby

This is the ruby program which generates a "best" choice for a turn in the
game of Marienbad; the choice of row and number of sticks will ensure
staying in a winning situation (if already in one) or will at least drag out
the game if in a losing situation.

See more at the wiki page for the game instructions:

Note: the mathematical strategy in the wiki page was not used for the program.
